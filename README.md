Features of ACTUAL script

written in: Terraform Language (Declarative)

Advantages of using script over traditional method of creating resources & methods i.e. AWS management console's UI:
1. Saves time & energy of developers, especially for methods which follow the default settings
2. Reduces chances of making CORS errors or any other errors concerning AWS setup
3. Requires zero knowledge of AWS to create methods which follow the default settings

Note: Atleast 80% of the methods are observed to follow the set default settings, for which the script promises to express its advantages 1 and 3 the best.

Other advantages:
1. Compatible with any existing work/innovation on Terraform of your organization
2. Easy & streamlined methods to override the default settings to cater to your specific configuration needs.
3. Written using Terraform's (most famous IaC 2022) built-in language: Terraform Language

Disadvantages:
1. Newer version of script might be backwards incompatible as Terraform Language is a work in progress. Though migration from older version to newer version process will help.
2. Since such a script is a novel idea, author is yet to assess its market value and usability. Trial runs & feedback loops are being performed.

Pre-requisities for using the script:
1. Terraform
2. AWS CLI
3. AWS access key

How to setup the script (one time setup):
1. Enter your AWS access key using `aws configure` command of AWS CLI
2. Configure the script for default settings. Make sure to choose those settings as default which majority of your methods are expected to follow.
